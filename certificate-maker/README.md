# Certificate-maker

Using JavaScript in a PDF to quickly and easily generate multiple (40-50) course completion certificates.

# Problem Statement

Initial Problem: I designed a certificate template for a teacher to distribute to her students. She loved it but then, basically, asked, “So do I just have you make a bunch of these and type their names in them so I can distribute them in a class?”

No. The answer was most definitely no. That wasn’t going to happen. I didn’t want to simply tell her no, however, and seem like an uncooperative team player (which is the only possible outcome of me stating that was her job, problem, etc.).

# Solution 

While I mulled over how to do that in a way that didn’t suck, I put together a prototype for a single name so I could hammer out the process and code. As it turns out, the prototype worked far faster and better than the other possible solutions. Check it out.

After creating all the certificates they need, the teacher saves the PDF and emails it to her students.
